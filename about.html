  <h2>What is culture?</h2>
  <div class="text">
    <p>Culture can be defined in countless ways. Through history it has been described from
      different theoretical perspectives, as a part of the psyche, as a biological reaction to the
      environment, from an anthropological and social point of view, from an organizational
      perspective, from a national perspective, etc. The subject could not be vaster.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Culture is a set of patterns and behaviours acquired and transmitted by symbols
      (Kroeber & Kluckhohn, 1952), to which spiritual, intellectual and emotional features are attached to
      (UNESCO, 2002) and is charged with a particular meaning and intention. It provides
      information systems, which are specific and unique to the environment in which that culture
      exists (Matsumoto, 2007).
      Culture is not only what one sees on the surface, it is also the invisible and to a degree the
      unconscious (Schein, 2010, Freud, 1960). It is what we know we do not know, the
      unconscious culture (Wilson, 2002)</p>
    <br />
    <p>Like personalities, cultures are also biased by the choices within the meaning range.
      Culture, as a universal frame in which people are born into, happens in the process of
      enculturation or internalization of the social consensus that pre-exist the individual. Between the tension of
      integration in that social consensus and the requirements for the individual
      development, the subject is constituted as such within that social context (Vygotsky, 1978).</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Culture is what we are taught, how we think, how we act and what we know. It is something
      inseparable of the human condition that also defines and affects our personality (Benedict,
      1965).
      What are the influences in that process that make the population of a nation think and act so
      differently from other nations?
      Do we really think and act differently, or are those information systems fed by our own
      cultures that generates a judgement toward the unknown from a different culture?</p>
